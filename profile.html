    <br>
    Acquired in 1990 by the Charmaran Company, K &amp; L Stamping began operations in 1976
    as a supplier of die cut insulation parts exclusively for Sears &amp; Belding, a major
    appliance manufacturer. K &amp; L also specialized in the production of stampings from
    vulcanized fiber, insulation papers, phenolics and other nonmetal materials for the
    appliance industry. Charmaran changed the name but retained the K &amp; L tradition of
    producing quality parts at competitive prices.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">Expansion in 1991 added two distinct product
    lines. One line manufactures precision roll formed motor mounting rings for appliance
    motors; the other produces locking devices for fiber drum containers. </font></td>

    for excellence, Charmaran added larger tonnage presses and additional plant capacity.
    Specialized services were also added to make Charmaran one-stop stamping house. These
    include product engineering, tool and die design capabilities, prototypes, steel rule die
    cutting and value added secondary operations requiring welding and riveting and material
